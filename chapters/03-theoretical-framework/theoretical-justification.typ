== Theoretical Justification

=== Why Pattern Recognition Theory?

Pattern Recognition Theory is the most appropriate primary lens for this study because the Statement of the Problem explicitly identifies the limitation of *predefined categorical labels* in constraining the discovery of latent resistance structures. Pattern recognition, by definition, seeks to discover regularities that are not explicitly encoded in the data representation. The unsupervised component (hierarchical clustering) allows resistance patterns to emerge from phenotypic similarity rather than being imposed by external classification schemes.

Furthermore, the integration of supervised validation addresses the acknowledged weakness of unsupervised methods: the lack of external criteria for evaluating cluster quality. The theoretical framework thus provides both the mechanism for discovery (unsupervised learning) and the mechanism for validation (supervised learning), directly responding to the dual challenges articulated in the SOP.

=== Why One Health Framework?

The One Health Framework is essential for situating the study within the broader public health discourse on antimicrobial resistance. The Water--Fish--Human nexus is not an arbitrary data structure but a theoretically motivated representation of interconnected reservoirs where resistance genes and resistant organisms circulate.

Critically, the One Health Framework also provides epistemic constraints: it emphasizes surveillance, monitoring, and characterization rather than causal inference. This aligns with the study's commitment to associational language and its explicit avoidance of claims regarding resistance emergence mechanisms or transmission pathways. The theoretical framework thus serves both a constructive function (justifying the nexus perspective) and a regulatory function (constraining interpretive claims).

=== Why Information Leakage Theory?

The explicit incorporation of Information Leakage Theory distinguishes this study from naive applications of machine learning to biological data. The Statement of the Problem implicitly acknowledges the risk of methodological artifacts when it notes that unsupervised clustering alone provides "limited assurance" of coherent patterns. Information Leakage Theory provides the conceptual vocabulary for articulating these risks and the design principles for mitigating them.

The Split-Before-Transform protocol and Feature--Metadata Separation are not arbitrary design choices but theoretically mandated safeguards against a recognized class of methodological errors. By grounding these architectural decisions in established theory, the study demonstrates awareness of machine learning pitfalls and implements principled solutions.

=== Why Layered Software Architecture?

The adoption of a *Layered Architectural Style*  responds directly to the Statement of the Problem's identification of an "absence of an integrated framework." Layered architecture is specifically suited to sequential data processing workflows, where each layer transforms inputs and passes outputs to the next layer without circular dependencies.

The three-layer structure (Data Layer → Analysis Layer → Presentation Layer) maps directly onto the methodological progression from preprocessing to pattern discovery to interpretation. This architectural style enforces separation of concerns, preventing the conflation of analytical and interpretive operations that could compromise objectivity.
