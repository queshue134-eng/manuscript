== Introduction

This chapter establishes the theoretical foundations underpinning the development of a pattern recognition system for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within the Water--Fish--Human nexus. The theoretical framework draws from three interconnected domains: (1) computational pattern recognition theory, (2) public health surveillance epistemology, and (3) software systems design principles. Together, these foundations provide the intellectual scaffolding for addressing the methodological challenges identified in the Statement of the Problem and justify the design decisions implemented in the Architectural Design.
