== Supporting Theoretical Concepts

=== Information Leakage Theory in Machine Learning

A critical supporting concept is *Information Leakage Theory*, which addresses the methodological risk of inadvertently incorporating information from test data into model training, leading to overoptimistic performance estimates . Leakage violates the fundamental assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) training and evaluation sets.

The study operationalizes leakage prevention through two architectural constraints derived from this theory:

    [*Temporal Leakage*], [Future information influencing past predictions], [Not applicable (cross-sectional data)],
    [*Feature Leakage*],
    [Target-derived features in input],
    [Feature--metadata separation; metadata excluded from clustering],

    [*Preprocessing Leakage*],
    [Statistics computed on full dataset],
    [Split-before-transform protocol; fit on training data only],
  ),

) <tab:leakage-types>

These constraints are not merely procedural but reflect the theoretical requirement that evaluation metrics must estimate generalization error on truly unseen data .

=== Ordinal Data Representation Theory

The encoding of antimicrobial susceptibility results (Susceptible/Intermediate/Resistant) as ordinal numerical values (0/1/2) is grounded in *Ordinal Data Theory* . Ordinal variables possess natural ordering but lack equidistant intervals between categories.

The choice of Euclidean distance for clustering ordinal resistance data is justified by research demonstrating that, for low-dimensional ordinal spaces with consistent encoding, Euclidean distance approximates ordinal dissimilarity with acceptable distortion . Alternative distance metrics (e.g., Gower distance, Manhattan distance) were considered; the study's stability analysis using Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) across alternative configurations validates the robustness of the Euclidean-based solution.

=== Multi-Drug Resistance Classification Theory

The classification of isolates as *multidrug-resistant (MDR)* follows the standardized definition established by Magiorakos et al. @magiorakos2011mdr:

#quote[
  An isolate is classified as MDR if it exhibits acquired non-susceptibility to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories.
]

This definition provides a theoretically grounded, internationally recognized framework for categorizing resistance breadth. The study's computation of MDR status as a derived feature operationalizes this definition, enabling downstream analysis of resistance pattern associations.
