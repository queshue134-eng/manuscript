== Chapter Summary

This chapter established the theoretical foundations for the AMR pattern recognition system developed in this study. The primary theoretical frameworks---Pattern Recognition Theory and One Health Framework---provide complementary lenses for addressing the computational and domain-specific challenges identified in the Statement of the Problem.

Supporting concepts including Information Leakage Theory, Ordinal Data Representation, and MDR Classification Standards operationalize these frameworks into specific methodological and architectural constraints. The derivation chain demonstrates how each design feature in the Architectural Design chapter traces back to established theoretical principles.

The theoretical framework ensures that the study's contributions are grounded in recognized scholarly traditions while maintaining methodological rigor appropriate to machine learning applications in public health surveillance.
