== Chapter Summary

This chapter presented a *comprehensive, leakage-aware methodology* for antimicrobial resistance pattern recognition using phenotypic AST data. The framework integrates unsupervised discovery, supervised validation, co-resistance analysis, and system-level evaluation while maintaining strict interpretive discipline.

The methodology ensures that resistance patterns are discovered through objective, data-driven processes and that all interpretive statements remain within appropriate associational bounds. The integrated framework supports reproducible execution and interactive exploration of results.
