== Research Design

This study adopts an exploratory, computational research design grounded in pattern recognition and machine learning to address the stated research objectives. The design is exploratory because it seeks to uncover latent antimicrobial resistance (AMR) structures that are not explicitly defined by existing categorical labels, rather than testing predefined hypotheses or establishing causal relationships. It is computational in nature because the primary contribution of the study lies in the design, implementation, and evaluation of a data-driven analytical framework for resistance pattern discovery and validation.

The research design integrates unsupervised learning for resistance structure discovery with supervised learning used exclusively as an external validation mechanism. Unsupervised methods are employed to identify resistance patterns based solely on phenotypic similarity in antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) data, without incorporating biological, environmental, or geographic labels during the discovery phase. Supervised learning is subsequently applied to assess the discriminative capacity and robustness of the discovered patterns, thereby addressing the limitations of unsupervised clustering when used in isolation.

The methodological strategy follows a staged, leakage-aware pipeline consisting of: (1) data preprocessing and feature engineering, (2) unsupervised resistance pattern discovery, (3) supervised validation, (4) integrated system design, and (5) quantitative evaluation. Throughout the study, strict separation is maintained between pattern discovery and interpretation to prevent information leakage and circular reasoning. The study is associational and descriptive in scope; no biological mechanisms, epidemiological transmission pathways, or clinical outcomes are inferred.
