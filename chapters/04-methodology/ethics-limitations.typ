// Section: Ethical Considerations and Limitations

== Ethical Considerations

This study involved the secondary analysis of environmental and aquaculture-associated bacterial isolates. No human subjects, clinical samples, or personal identifiers were included in the dataset. The dataset was anonymized prior to analysis, and all results are reported at an aggregate level. Ethical approval was therefore not required for this computational study.

== Limitations

The following methodological limitations are acknowledged:

+ *Scope limitation:* The dataset represents the Water–Fish interface; direct human clinical isolates are not included, limiting generalizability to the full Water–Fish–Human nexus.

+ *Temporal limitation:* The study analyzes a single cross-sectional dataset; temporal dynamics of resistance evolution cannot be assessed.

+ *Imputation effects:* Median imputation may introduce bias for antibiotics with highly skewed resistance distributions.

+ *Clustering assumptions:* Ward's linkage assumes spherical clusters and may not capture non-convex resistance pattern structures.

+ *External validation:* Supervised validation assesses internal discriminative capacity but does not validate against external AMR surveillance datasets.
