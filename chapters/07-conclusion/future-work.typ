== Future Research Directions

While this study provides a foundation for machine learning-based AMR surveillance, several avenues for future research are recommended:

=== Methodological Extensions

1. *Genotypic Integration*: Complement phenotypic clustering with whole-genome sequencing data to link resistance clusters to specific resistance genes and mobile genetic elements, enabling mechanistic interpretation of phenotype patterns.

2. *Temporal Analysis*: Extend the retrospective analysis to include longitudinal data, enabling detection of emerging resistance trends and cluster evolution over time.

3. *Deep Learning Approaches*: Explore neural network architectures for resistance pattern recognition, potentially capturing non-linear relationships not detected by hierarchical clustering.

=== Geographic Expansion

1. *National Coverage*: Expand the analysis to include additional Philippine regions beyond BARMM, Central Luzon, and Eastern Visayas to establish a comprehensive national resistance phenotype atlas.

2. *Southeast Asian Comparison*: Compare Philippine resistance clusters with patterns observed in neighboring countries to assess regional transmission dynamics @xie2025seasia.

=== Clinical Translation

1. *Prospective Validation*: Validate the clustering methodology prospectively using newly collected isolates to confirm generalizability beyond the training dataset.

2. *Clinical Outcome Linkage*: Correlate resistance cluster membership with patient clinical outcomes to assess whether phenotype stratification predicts treatment response.

3. *Real-time Dashboard*: Deploy the Streamlit dashboard as a web-accessible tool for real-time AMR surveillance visualization by regional health authorities.

=== One Health Applications

1. *Animal Health Integration*: Incorporate veterinary isolates beyond fish samples to capture the full spectrum of animal-derived resistance in the One Health framework.

2. *Environmental Sampling*: Expand environmental surveillance to include sediment, wastewater, and agricultural samples to comprehensively map resistance reservoirs.

These extensions would strengthen the evidence base for machine learning-assisted AMR surveillance and accelerate translation of computational insights into public health action.
