// Section 7.2: Recommendations
== Recommendations

Based on the findings of this study, the following recommendations are proposed for AMR surveillance, public health practice, and future research:

=== For Public Health Authorities

1. *Prioritize BARMM for AMR Intervention*: Given that 66 of 123 MDR Cluster 3 isolates (53.7%) originate from BARMM, targeted antimicrobial stewardship programs and enhanced laboratory capacity should be prioritized in this region.

2. *Integrate Environmental Surveillance*: The identification of distinct resistance phenotypes in water (C1) and fish (C2–C4) sources supports the implementation of One Health surveillance frameworks that monitor AMR across human, animal, and environmental sectors @franklin2024onehealth.

3. *Monitor Co-resistance Patterns*: The strong tetracycline-doxycycline co-resistance (Phi=0.81) suggests that empirical therapy guidelines should consider cross-resistance when selecting treatment regimens, particularly in regions with high tetracycline use in aquaculture.

=== For Healthcare Practitioners

1. *Species-Specific Empiric Therapy*: The clustering results indicate that _Salmonella_ isolates (C1) exhibit distinct aminoglycoside resistance patterns compared to _E. coli_/_K. pneumoniae_ (C3/C4), supporting species-guided empiric antibiotic selection.

2. *MDR Risk Stratification*: Isolates from fish-derived sources in BARMM should be considered higher risk for MDR, warranting more aggressive susceptibility testing before treatment initiation.

=== For Surveillance Programs

1. *Adopt Phenotypic Clustering*: The validated clustering methodology provides a reproducible approach for stratifying resistance phenotypes that can be integrated into routine national AMR surveillance programs @arsp2024.

2. *Leverage Machine Learning*: The demonstrated 92% validation accuracy supports the deployment of supervised classifiers for automated resistance phenotype prediction in clinical microbiology laboratories.

3. *Standardize Data Collection*: Consistent AST panel coverage across regions would enhance clustering precision and enable more robust temporal trend analysis.

=== For Aquaculture Management

1. *Reduce Antibiotic Use*: The concentration of MDR isolates in fish samples (69 of 123 C3 isolates, 56.1%) indicates aquaculture environments as significant resistance reservoirs, supporting policies to reduce prophylactic antibiotic use in aquaculture operations @yusuf2024aquatic.

2. *Water Quality Monitoring*: The water-associated _Salmonella_ cluster (C1) suggests that water quality improvements could reduce environmental resistance transmission.
