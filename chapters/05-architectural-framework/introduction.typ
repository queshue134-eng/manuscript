== Introduction

This chapter presents the architectural design of the implemented pattern recognition system for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within the Water--Fish--Human nexus. The architecture described in this chapter corresponds to a fully implemented and operational system, rather than a conceptual or proposed design.

The system processes antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) data from bacterial isolates (_Escherichia coli_, _Salmonella_ spp., _Shigella_ spp., and _Vibrio cholerae_) collected across environmental and clinical sample sources. Environmental and regional metadata are preserved throughout the pipeline but are intentionally excluded from analytical computations to ensure unbiased pattern discovery.
