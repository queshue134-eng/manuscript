== Statement of the Problem

Existing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance frameworks rely on predefined categorical labels—such as species classifications, clinical breakpoints, and resistance prevalence summaries—that constrain how phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) data are represented and analyzed, thereby limiting the ability of pattern recognition methods to discover latent resistance structure.

In heterogeneous datasets from the Water–Fish–Human nexus, such as the INOHAC–Project 2 AST data, resistance profiles are noisy and inconsistently encoded, and unsupervised clustering alone provides limited assurance that discovered patterns are coherent, discriminative, or robust.

The absence of an integrated, leakage-aware pattern recognition framework that combines data preprocessing, unsupervised structure discovery, supervised validation, and systematic evaluation restricts the effective application of machine learning for quantitative characterization of antimicrobial resistance patterns across interconnected environmental and human-associated reservoirs.
