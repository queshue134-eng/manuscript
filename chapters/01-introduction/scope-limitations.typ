// 1.5 Scope and Limitations

== Scope and Limitations

=== Scope

This study encompasses the following:

+ *Data Source*: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) data from 491 bacterial isolates collected through the INOHAC AMR Project Two across three Philippine regions: BARMM, Central Luzon (Region III), and Eastern Visayas (Region VIII).

+ *Organisms*: Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae including _Escherichia coli_, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, _Enterobacter_ species, and _Salmonella_ species isolated from water, fish, and hospital sources.

+ *Antibiotics*: A panel of 22 antibiotics spanning major classes including penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, and carbapenems, as tested according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.

+ *Analytical Methods*: Hierarchical agglomerative clustering (Ward's linkage, Euclidean distance), principal component analysis (PCA), Random Forest classification, and Phi coefficient co-resistance analysis.

+ *Temporal Scope*: Cross-sectional analysis of isolates collected during the INOHAC AMR Project Two sampling period.

=== Limitations

+ *Phenotypic Focus*: This study analyzes phenotypic resistance profiles (susceptible/intermediate/resistant) without genotypic characterization. Resistance mechanisms and mobile genetic elements are inferred but not directly confirmed.

+ *Retrospective Design*: Analysis was conducted on historical AST data, precluding prospective validation or temporal trend analysis.

+ *Regional Representation*: The three study regions may not be representative of all Philippine provinces, limiting generalizability to unstudied areas.

+ *Missing Data*: Some isolates lacked complete antibiotic panel coverage, potentially affecting cluster assignments for partially tested specimens.

+ *Environmental Context*: While One Health sampling captured water, fish, and hospital sources, additional environmental compartments (soil, wastewater, wildlife) were not included.
