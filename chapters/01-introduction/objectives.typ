// 1.3 Objectives of the Study

== Objectives of the Study

=== General Objective

To develop a pattern recognition system for antimicrobial resistance in the Water–Fish–Human nexus by preprocessing phenotypic AST data from the INOHAC–Project 2, applying unsupervised clustering to discover latent resistance structures, and employing supervised machine learning algorithms to validate and interpret the discriminative capacity of identified resistance patterns.

=== Specific Objectives

Specifically, this study aims to:

+ To preprocess and engineer features from the INOHAC–Project 2 phenotypic AST dataset, including data cleaning, resistance encoding, and computation of derived features, in order to create an analysis-ready dataset suitable for pattern recognition in the Water–Fish–Human nexus.

+ To apply unsupervised hierarchical clustering for resistance phenotype discovery and to evaluate multiple supervised machine learning algorithms for their capacity to discriminate and validate the identified resistance patterns derived from the processed dataset.

+ To design and develop an integrated pattern recognition framework that incorporates data-driven cluster selection, leakage-safe model training, and an interactive visualization dashboard for exploring resistance profiles, regional distributions, and co-resistance relationships.

+ To evaluate the pattern recognition system using appropriate quantitative metrics and to interpret the resulting resistance patterns within the context of the Water–Fish–Human nexus without inferring causality.
