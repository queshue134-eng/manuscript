// Section 6.4: Statistical Analysis and Characterization
== Statistical Analysis and Characterization <sec:statistical-analysis>

This section presents complementary statistical analyses that characterize the identified resistance phenotypes within their epidemiological context. These include dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), examination of regional and environmental distribution patterns, and co-resistance network relationships.

=== Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on the 22-dimensional encoded resistance data to visualize the underlying structure and assess its dimensionality.

@tab:pca-variance details the contributions of the first five principal components (PC) to the total variance of the isolate profiles. In this table, *Component* identifies the PC axis, *Variance Explained (%)* indicates how much of the dataset's total information is captured by that specific component, and *Cumulative (%)* shows the total variance accounted for by all components up to that point.

    [PC5], [7.02%], [68.26%],
  ),

) <tab:pca-variance>

The first two principal components capture 39.92% of the total variance, which is characteristic of high-dimensional phenotypic data where resistance patterns are influenced by multiple independent genetic determinants. Five components are required to exceed 68% cumulative variance, indicating substantial dimensionality in the resistance phenotype space. Despite the limited variance captured in two dimensions, the PCA projection reveals visually distinguishable cluster separation, particularly along PC1 which correlates strongly with the tetracycline–doxycycline resistance axis that defines the MDR Cluster 3 @selvam2024network.

=== Regional Distribution Patterns

The four resistance clusters exhibited differential distribution across the three participating regions, revealing significant regional heterogeneity.

  ),
  caption: [Regional distribution of resistance phenotype clusters (percentage of each cluster by region)],
) <tab:cluster-region>

*Central Luzon Dominance in C1:* Cluster 1 (_Salmonella_-Aminoglycoside phenotype) shows strong geographic localization to Region III – Central Luzon, with 17 of 23 isolates (73.9%) originating from this region. This concentration suggests localized _Salmonella_ circulation in Central Luzon water systems or region-specific aminoglycoside selection pressure from agricultural antibiotic use.

*BARMM Concentration of MDR:* The MDR Archetype cluster (C3) shows predominant representation in BARMM, with 66 of 123 isolates (53.7%) originating from this region, making BARMM the primary hotspot for multidrug-resistant _E. coli_ and _K. pneumoniae_ @ng2025philippines. BARMM also harbors 143 of 252 C4 isolates (56.7%), indicating both the highest MDR burden and largest reservoir of currently-susceptible isolates vulnerable to future resistance acquisition.

=== Environmental Niche Associations

    [*Total*], [*55.8%*], [*8.4%*], [*35.8%*], [*100%*],
  ),
  caption: [Environmental distribution of resistance phenotype clusters],
) <tab:cluster-environment>

*Water-Associated C1:* Cluster 1 shows the strongest water association, with 16 of 23 isolates (69.6%) from water samples, no hospital representation, and only 7 of 23 (30.4%) from fish samples—consistent with _Salmonella_ waterborne ecology.

*Hospital Penetration in C3/C4:* Clusters 3 and 4 are the only clusters with hospital-derived isolates (9 of 123 [7.3%] and 32 of 252 [12.7%] respectively). The higher hospital proportion in the susceptible C4 compared to MDR C3 may reflect that MDR acquisition occurs primarily in environmental reservoirs before clinical introduction.

*Fish Dominance:* Fish samples predominate in Clusters 2–4 (53.8%–58.7%), underscoring aquaculture systems as key resistance reservoirs consistent with the One Health framework @franklin2024onehealth.

=== Co-resistance Pattern Analysis

To investigate the complex interactions between resistances, pairwise co-occurrence patterns of resistance profiles were analyzed. This analysis aims to uncover significant associations that may reflect shared genetic mechanisms, co-selection pressures, or cross-resistance phenomena within the isolate population.

==== Phi Coefficient Analysis

Co-resistance relationships between antibiotic pairs were quantified using Phi coefficients, with significance determined via chi-square testing @martiny2024coabundance. Pairs exhibiting Phi > 0.3 and p \< 0.001 were considered statistically significant co-resistance associations. In @tab:coresistance-pairs, *Antibiotic Pair* lists the combinations evaluated, *Phi Coefficient* measures the strength of association (closer to 1.0 indicates stronger co-occurrence), and the *p-value* denotes statistical significance.

#figure(
  table(
    columns: 3,
    table.header[*Antibiotic Pair*][*Phi Coefficient*][*p-value*],
    [Doxycycline -- Tetracycline], [0.806], [$<$ 0.001],
    [Chloramphenicol -- Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole], [0.621], [$<$ 0.001],
    [Doxycycline -- Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole], [0.559], [$<$ 0.001],
    [Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole -- Tetracycline], [0.470], [$<$ 0.001],
    [Cefoxitin -- Ceftiofur], [0.454], [$<$ 0.001],
  ),
  caption: [Top Significant Co-resistance Pairs],
) <tab:coresistance-pairs>

The strongest co-resistance association was observed between doxycycline and tetracycline (Phi = 0.806), reflecting shared resistance mechanisms via ribosomal protection proteins and efflux pumps @wang2022tetx4.

==== Co-resistance Network

Network analysis revealed hub antibiotics with high connectivity, indicating they frequently co-occur with resistance to multiple other agents. These hub positions suggest potential targets for resistance surveillance prioritization.

Key findings from the network topology:
- *Ampicillin* exhibited the highest degree centrality, connecting to 8 other resistance phenotypes
- Fluoroquinolone resistance (enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin) formed a tightly connected subnetwork

==== Clinical Implications

The identified co-resistance patterns have direct implications for empirical therapy selection. The strong tetracycline-doxycycline linkage suggests that resistance to one tetracycline should prompt consideration of alternative therapies across the class. Similarly, fluoroquinolone co-resistance patterns align with mechanistic understanding of efflux-mediated cross-resistance @shariati2022fqmechanisms.
