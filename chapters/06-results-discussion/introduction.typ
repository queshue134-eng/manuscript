// Section 6.1: Introduction
== Introduction

This chapter presents the empirical findings of the antimicrobial resistance pattern recognition analysis conducted on 491 bacterial isolates collected from the water-fish-human nexus across three Philippine regions: BARMM (Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao), Region III (Central Luzon), and Region VIII (Eastern Visayas).

The results are organized in a logical progression that mirrors the analytical pipeline:
- *Hierarchical Clustering Results* presents the resistance phenotype clusters identified through hierarchical agglomerative clustering
- *Cluster Validation and Statistical Performance* evaluates the statistical validity of the clustering solution using silhouette analysis and PCA
- *Co-resistance Pattern Analysis* examines co-resistance patterns and network relationships
- *Regional and Environmental Distribution Patterns* contextualizes the clusters within their geographic and environmental settings
- *Discussion* interprets the biological implications and synthesizes findings with existing literature

The presentation adheres to a data-driven approach wherein every quantitative claim is substantiated by values extracted directly from the computed artifacts generated by the analysis pipeline @abamo2024inohac.
