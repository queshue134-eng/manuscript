=== Regional Distribution Patterns

The four resistance clusters exhibited differential distribution across the three participating regions, revealing significant regional heterogeneity.

*Central Luzon Dominance in C1:* Cluster 1 (_Salmonella_-Aminoglycoside phenotype) shows strong geographic localization to Region III – Central Luzon, with 17 of 23 isolates (73.9%) originating from this region. This concentration suggests localized _Salmonella_ circulation in Central Luzon water systems or region-specific aminoglycoside selection pressure from agricultural antibiotic use.

*BARMM Concentration of MDR:* The MDR Archetype cluster (C3) shows predominant representation in BARMM, with 66 of 123 isolates (53.7%) originating from this region, making BARMM the primary hotspot for multidrug-resistant _E. coli_ and _K. pneumoniae_ @ng2025philippines. BARMM also harbors 143 of 252 C4 isolates (56.7%), indicating both the highest MDR burden and largest reservoir of currently-susceptible isolates vulnerable to future resistance acquisition.

=== Environmental Niche Associations

*Water-Associated C1:* Cluster 1 shows the strongest water association, with 16 of 23 isolates (69.6%) from water samples, no hospital representation, and only 7 of 23 (30.4%) from fish samples—consistent with _Salmonella_ waterborne ecology.

*Hospital Penetration in C3/C4:* Clusters 3 and 4 are the only clusters with hospital-derived isolates (9 of 123 [7.3%] and 32 of 252 [12.7%] respectively). The higher hospital proportion in the susceptible C4 compared to MDR C3 may reflect that MDR acquisition occurs primarily in environmental reservoirs before clinical introduction.

*Fish Dominance:* Fish samples predominate in Clusters 2–4 (53.8%–58.7%), underscoring aquaculture systems as key resistance reservoirs consistent with the One Health framework @franklin2024onehealth.
